- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tim
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cheminformatics and chemical database preparation.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about common algorithms and ML.

My career focus has been on cheminforamtics and database creation at the ultra-large scale (starting in the billions). Additionally, I'm interested in extracting useful information from these ultra-large databases at scale.
